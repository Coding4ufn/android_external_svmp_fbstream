PREPARE:

1.) Create symbolic links trunk/ndk and trunk/sdk which link to your local copy of the latest Android NDK and SDK respectively.
2.) cd trunk && ./prepare.sh 
3.) make -j 4 -- will build everything
4.) copy the file to the SVMP build.
    - create symbolic link trunk/SVMP which points to the root of your SVMP build directory
    - cp trunk/out/Debug/fbstream-pvx  trunk/SVMP/out/target/product/svmp/system/bin/

# Then consult SVMP documentation on how to build an image that can be imported into your VM.
